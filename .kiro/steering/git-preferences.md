# Git Command Preferences

## Git Diff Usage
- Always try to use git commands without git prompting for user input (e.g. by default git diff using vi/m and needs to be closed)
- Show diffs directly in command output for immediate review

## Other Git Preferences
- Show git status when relevant to understand current state
- Do not commit to git unless explicitly asked.
