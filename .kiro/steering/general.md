- I use homebrew to install packages, use that
- If scripting is necessary in Kubernetes resources (like AnalysisTemplates), it should be in separate Python/shell files and included via ConfigMaps, not embedded inline in YAML
- All our infrastructure is code. If a manual change is made to a k8s resource to test a fix, do not forget to update the code.
- Do not create uneccessary .md files. Useful information should either be in the appropriate spec, or in the appropriate README.md
- Don't create new spec folders without confirming; new requirements often part of an existing spec.
- Requirements should be generic and focus on the outcomes. Do not include implementation specific details.
- When reviewing new requirements, ensure the existing requirements for the spec are understood & modify them where applicable rather than adding new ones
- Only change the requirements if the outcomes themselves are changing.
- If you regularly execute a command, consider adding it to an appropriate Taskfile and using it from there.
- The lab k8s cluster is managed by proxmox and should be regularly tested by reverting to a clean state, before argo is installed and then runnign the init task `task seed:_init`
- Any component we write a spec for should consider how its tested
- Do not introduce unecessary complexity by supporting "backwards compatability" when a component is solely within this repo (e.g helm ingress), support the new feature, keep it simple & migrate any existing uses to the new structure.
