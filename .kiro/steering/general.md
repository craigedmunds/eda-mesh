- I use homebrew to install packages, use that
- If scripting is necessary in Kubernetes resources (like AnalysisTemplates), it should be in separate Python/shell files and included via ConfigMaps, not embedded inline in YAML
- All our infrastructure is code. If a manual change is made to a k8s resource to test a fix, do not forget to update the code.
