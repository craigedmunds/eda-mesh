# State files are auto-generated by Image Factory

#   └── base-images/     - Upstream base images (node-22-bookworm-slim.yaml, etc.)
#
# images/ contains:
# - References to base images
# - Current version and digest
# - Rebuild state and history
# - Dependent images (if any)
#
# base-images/ contains:
# - Current digest and update timestamps
# - List of dependent images
# - Update history
#
# You can commit these files for audit trail, or add to .gitignore
# if you prefer the system to regenerate them on each run.
