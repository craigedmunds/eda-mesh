                                    and will immediately cause the Promotion to be marked as failed without
                                    further condition.

                                    Timeout is the soft maximum interval in which a step that returns a Running
                                    status (which typically indicates it's waiting for something to happen)
                                    may be retried.

                                    The maximum is a soft one because the check for whether the interval has
                                    elapsed occurs AFTER the step has run. This effectively means a step may
                                    run ONCE beyond the close of the interval.

                                    If this field is set to nil, the effective default will be a step-specific
                                    one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also nil), the effective
                                    default will be the system-wide default of 0.

                                    A value of 0 will cause the step to be retried indefinitely unless the
                                    ErrorThreshold is reached.
