chore: add GHCR permissions test workflow

- Add test-ghcr-permissions.yml to quickly verify GHCR access
- Temporarily disable auto-trigger for backstage.yml
- Test workflow builds minimal Alpine image to verify push permissions
- Provides clear diagnostics and troubleshooting steps

To test permissions:
1. Commit and push this change
2. Go to Actions → Test GHCR Permissions
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Check results in ~30 seconds

Once permissions are verified, re-enable backstage.yml auto-trigger.
